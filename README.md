# hey there! ðŸ‘‹

my name is w3lcharm, i'm kinda self-taught typescript/dart/c# (maybe) programmer.

i worked on such projects as:
- Zeolite - a multifunctional Discord bot (made with @fishyrene)
- RPC-Tool - an app for making custom Discord rich presence (also made with @fishyrene)
- Qommand - previously part of Zeolite, now a simple slash commands framework for oceanic.js
- ...also there will be something in summer 2024?
